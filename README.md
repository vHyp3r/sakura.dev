3.  **Configure Firebase (Optional):**

    Sakura utilizes Firebase for certain functionalities.  To enable these features, you need to configure Firebase.

    *   Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Enable the necessary Firebase services (e.g., Authentication, Database, Hosting).
    *   Copy your Firebase configuration object and replace the placeholders in `src/firebaseConfig.js` (if it exists) or add it to your environment variables.

    ```javascript
    // Example Firebase configuration (replace with your actual configuration)
    const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
      authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
      projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
      storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
      messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
      appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
      measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
    };
